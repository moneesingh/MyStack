This program creates Generic Stack.
There are unit tests to check integer and String values can be pushed and poppedout from the stack. There is also a test for StackOverflow exception when stack is full and we try to insert elements to Stack.

This Gradle test task will also generate html report. Which can be viewed to see standard output.
